## How It Works

- Type in your tasks and click the add button or press enter. And it moves to the task list section where you can edit your inputted task or delete it and push it into the section or task in progress (doing section).

- In the doings section tasks can only be deleted or pushed to the done section, it can't be edited.

- Then each section has a respective clear list button that clears all tasks inputted in each sections.
